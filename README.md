## Quality Assessment of the Reuters Vol. 2 Multilingual Corpus

[LREC 2016](http://lrec2016.lrec-conf.org/en/)
(10th edition of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference,

some of them with mappings
(e.g. a language tag for each article).
The XML file names in the corpus are numbered sequentially;
these numbers are the identifiers used here.
